# customer_banking# Call the create_cd_account function and pass the variables to the function used to prompt the user from the user.
# Print out the interest earned and updated CD account balance with interest earned for the given months.
# Call the main function.
# Hints and Considerations

# Consider what you've learned so far. Youâ€™ve learned how to create and import functions, pass arguments and variables into functions, refactor code, create and import class, create class methods, and instances.
# If you're struggling with how to start, consider creating one Python file that has all the functions first, then separate the functions into different files. Also, look back on some of the activities you did in class. Finally, you can use pseudocoding to help you write out the steps.
# Always commit your work and back it up with pushes to GitHub or GitLab. You don't want to lose hours of your hard work! Also make sure that your repo has a detailed README.md file.
# Requirements
